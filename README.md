# COMP1917-mechanicalTurk-JandL

List below - in the planned order you will implement them (first at the top) - your ideas for how you will make your mechanical turk behave.  Give brief reasons why you think each feature is important, and why you have chosen to implement them in this order.

1.  Mr Pass - starts spinoff if has resources, otherwise passes.  Why first? This is required to be the first Turk everyone submits.
2.  build an arc towards the center if has resources, otherwise check 1. Second, because it allows more edges to put campuses or block others from creating more arcs later in the game.
3.  build a campus if the are enough arc roads and resources to allow building of a campus, otherwise check 2. 3rd because arcs need to be built first before a third campus can be built, campuses generate students that are used to build.
4.  build GO8 if has resources and 70% of the board is filled up and total no. of GO8's owned<8, 4th, because it is used to improve campuses. hence, should be build afterwards.


Write below the plan you and your Turk Pair partner have devised to ensure you will be an effective team:

We will :
- come up with a more in depth strategy for our mechanical turk in our next meeting
- come up and split up the functions that will be needed in our AI
- implement the functions into a strategy
- reiterate improvement process
- win the competition!
